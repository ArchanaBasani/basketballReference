The	fundamental	idea	of	this	project	was	to	take	an	existing	sports	dataset	and	present	it	to	a	user	in	a	more	effective	way	by	storing	the	data	in	a	relational	database.	To	achieve	this,	we	decided	to	use	publically	available	data	from	last	yearâ€™s	NBA	season	and	clean	it	to	fit	our	needs.	As	sports	statistics	are	far	from	being	a	new	field	we	also	decided	to	start	by	presenting	a	set	of	conventional	views	that	most	users	of	an	application	like	this	would	expect.	Therefore,	the	real-world	benefit	would	ultimately	be	more	for	a	person	who	wanted	to	run	their	own	lowcost	NBA	statistics	website	than	a	person	looking	for	a	brand-new	perspective	on	NBA	data.	The	views	include	a	typical	NBA	box	score,	statistical	leader	view,	and	a	team	information	view.
